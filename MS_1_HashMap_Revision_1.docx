Product Inventory Management System using HashMap

You are tasked with developing a Product Inventory Management System in Java using HashMap. The system should provide users with functionalities to manage their inventory efficiently.

Functionalities to include:

1. Add Product: Users should be able to add new products to the system by providing the product's name and quantity.

2. Search and Delete Product: If a searched product is found, it is deleted from the inventory. If not the system notifies the user that the product was not found.

3. Display All Products: Users should have the option to view all
products stored in the system, including their names and quantities.

4. Total Number of Products: The system should display the total number of products stored in the inventory.

5. Clear Inventory: Users should be able to clear all products from the inventory in a single operation. 

Input format :
The first line consists of the size of the HashMap.
The next lines consist of values representing products in the following format: "Product Name, Product Quantity".
The last input consists of a String that represents the name to search and delete.

Output format :
The Output should display the product details.

Sample test cases :

Input 1:

3
Apples, 10
Bananas, 20
Oranges, 15
Bananas

Output 1:

Bananas's Quantity: 20
Bananas removed from inventory.
Total number of products: 2 
All Products:
Apples 10
Oranges 15
Inventory cleared


Input 2:

5
Books, 20 
Pens, 50
Notebooks, 30
Markers, 15
Erasers, 25
Pencil

Output 2:

Output 2:
Pencil does not exist in the inventory.
Total number of products: 5
All Products:
Erasers - 25
Markers - 15
Notebooks - 30
Books - 20
Pens - 50
Inventory cleared
